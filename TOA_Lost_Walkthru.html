1. Leaving Home
<br>
The story begins with a series of dreams explaining your origin. You grew up as an orphan
on a farm raised by your loving stepparents, Tobias and Margo. Your stepmother passed away
years ago. Your stepfather died when he torched your home to save you from a werewolf only
days ago. Cast out into the world, you travel to the city of Edinburg.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q1a>a. Arrival at Edinburg</a>
<br>Upon arriving at Edinburg, you spot a child named Raffie picking the pocket of a noble
named Winifred Bedime. Your decision to side with Raffie or Winifred will be important later
on.
<br>
<br><a name=q1b>b. Getting a Job</a>
<br>There are two choices for work: the Thieve's Guild or the City Guard. If you ratted on
Raffie, Benny won't let you enter the Thieve's Guild in the Slums. You can still join the
City Guard in the City Guard Office in the Government District by speaking to Captain Thorin.
<br>
<br><a name=q1c>c. Rising Evil</a>
<br>After speaking to the resident's of Edinburg, you'll discover that the city is teeming
with rumours about rising evil. Vampires and zombies are said to stalk the night, werewolves
are heard howling in the Mistwood beyond the South Gate, orcs from Anfang forest have driven
farmers out of their homes beyond the West Gate, and a rival thieve's guild called the Shadow 
Weavers have taken over the Deep Slums.

2. The Bloody Daggers
<br>
If you didn't join the Thieve's Guild, you can skip this section. Ameril commands the Bloody Daggers. 
You'll discover that he was once a great adventurer who travelled with Lord Rayson (of the Elder Council), 
Reverend Townsend (of the Temple of Numiennen), and Safana Moonbow (who married Lord Rayson and had a 
baby girl named Merilee, but they died about a year ago). Once you join the Bloody Daggers, you will have 
access to the lower level where you can rest for free.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q2a>a. Golden Goblet</a>
<br>Your first quest for Ameril is to retrieve the Golden Goblet in the Goldfoot Estate of the Noble's 
District. To enter the District, you can either convince Commander Axeworthy to let you in, or you can go 
through the sewers in the far eastern side of the Slums. Once you reach the Goldfoot Estate, you can use 
the key Ameril gave you to enter through the back, or you can pick the lock to enter through the front. 
The house guards are not particularly perceptive, so they should be easy enough to sneak past. If you're 
caught by one of them, they'll give you a warning: if you convince him to leave you alone, he'll stop 
harrassing you. If you fail to convince him, the next time he spots you, he'll attack. There is no 
experience for killing guards (in fact, Ameril will reprimand you), so fighting isn't the best option here. 
Once you get inside the estate, you'll find two more guards. If you rummage through one of the chests in 
the kitchen, you'll find a servant uniform that allows you to automatically persuade the guards to let you 
pass. The Goblet is on the pedestal in the den.
<br>
<br><a name=q2b>b. Kyra</a>
<br>Your second quest is to retrieve documents from a spy named Kyra in the Deep Slums. You can enter the 
Deep Slums through the sewers or through the Deep Slum gates if you convince Commander Axeworthy to let you 
pass. Kyra can be found on the other side of the ruined tower in the Deep Slums, but she will not talk to 
you unless you wear the ring Ameril gave you. Once you've retrieved the documents, Kyra will ask you to help 
her escape. If you agree, the Shadow Weavers go hostile in the area, so make sure you're prepared to sneak or 
fight. Try to avoid going near Pratt, who is particularly tough. Kyra has surprisingly good survival skills, 
but at this stage of your character's career, you'll have a tough time fighting through the hostiles in the 
area. Stealth is your best approach. You don't have to help her, but if you do, you'll be rewarded. If you're 
mean to Kyra, she won't chat with you after rewarding you.
<br>
<br><a name=q2c>c. Temple Attack</a>
<br>Your third quest is to attend a ceremony mourning the passing of Safana and Merilee at the Temple of 
Numiennen. During the ceremony, vampires attack the temple and kill Reverend Townsend. Once you exit the Temple, 
you will have a dream about Tobias again. You'll wake up feeling guilty about fleeing the werewolf that attacked 
your home. This dream is symbolic, but it also simulates that a night has passed after the Temple attack. When 
you speak to Ameril next, he'll reject your entry in the Bloody Daggers so you can work for Lord Rayson instead.
</blockquote>

<a href=#top>top</a>
<br>
<hr width=100%></hr>

<a name=q3></a>
<br><a name=q3>3. The City Guard</a>
<br>
If you didn't join the City Guard, you can skip this section. Thorin captains the City Guard in the City Guard 
Barracks. When you join the City Guard, you're given keys to the Training Barracks where you can get some free 
supplies and the Guard Barracks where you can rest. Both are just outside the office. You'll begin your career 
with the City Guard by doing a guard orientation with Thorin.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q3a>a. Jonesy</a>
<br>Your first mission with the City Guard is to patrol the Noble's District. Captain Seran will let you pass when you tell
him who you are. When you pass the Goldfoot estate gate, you'll spot a thief entering the property while the guards are on
a break. Follow him inside and talk to him. At this point, you have the option of letting him go, arresting him, or killing
him. Don't go rummaging through the containers if you want to maintain a lawful alignment.
<br>
<br><a name=q3b>b. Belching Boar</a>
<br>Your second mission is to investigate a barfight between a city guardsman named Braden and a beggar named Jake at the
Belching Boar tavern in the Slums. Besides those two, you can also speak to Bulger the Fat, Gaul, and Mela at the Belching
Boar in your investigation. Gaul gives you a testimony saying that Braden started the fight. If you dig around a bit, Mela
will also give you a testimony saying that Braden was protecting her from Jake, who had become drunk and was making advances
at her. You have to decide which one is lying when you report to Thorin, although you technically only need one testimony
to complete the quest.
<br>
<br><a name=q3c>c. Temple Attack</a>
<br>Your third quest is to attend a ceremony mourning the passing of Safana and Merilee at the Temple of Numiennen. During 
the ceremony, vampires attack the temple and kill Reverend Townsend. Once you exit the Temple, you will have a dream about 
Tobias again. You'll wake up feeling guilty about fleeing the werewolf that attacked your home. This dream is symbolic, 
but it also simulates that a night has passed after the Temple attack. When you speak to Thorin next, he'll dismiss you from 
the City Guard so you can work for Lord Rayson instead.
</blockquote>


<a href=#top>top</a>
<br>
<hr width=100%></hr>

<a name=q4></a>
<br>4. Joining Rayson
<br>
At this point, the city is buzzing with talk about the rising evil in Edinburg. You can talk to Lord Rayson to offer your
services to him in the investigation. In your conversation with him, you'll discover that his wife and daughter were killed
a year ago in a vampire attack. In addition to the recent death of his old companion Jerol Townsend, he has a particular
desire to end the rising evil. Lord Rayson, Ameril, and Thorin should give you a hint that Jonas the Cryptkeeper has
recently disappeared. To investigate the rising evil, you should patrol the streets at night.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q4a>a. Henchmen</a>
<br>If might be a good idea to get some equipment at this point. Your henchmen will come quite well-equipped, so they'll be 
valuable in the days to come. There are three henchmen available, but none of them are available until after the Temple attack 
(Persey is only available after you've agreed to help Lord Rayson):
<br>
<blockquote>
	i) Persey
	<br>
	Persey is a succubus in the employ of the Fox's Tail brothel in the Merchant's District. To enter the brothel, you
	need to wear one of the four tunics sold by Chapelle - each costs about 1500 gold. You'll need another 500 gold to 		
	enter the Bordello to see Persey. Once you've talked to Persey, you can ask Bentley to free her. He'll offer you a 		
	compromise: if you kill a man extorting money from him, you'll get one night with Persey. If you accept, go to the
	warehouse in the Merchant's District to meet Kalid, the extortioner. If you kill Kalid, you'll get your night with
	Persey and get a bonus point to your charisma. If you talk to Kalid, he'll tell you that he's actually Madame Ives' 		
	cousin. If you allow Kalid to live and tell Madame Ives about her husband's plot to kill him, you'll never get Persey 	
	in your party. 	If you allow Kalid to live and go directly to Bentley, you can use his fear of his wife to force him 		
	to release Persey.
	<br>
	<br>
	ii) Evanine
	<br>
	Evanine is an Akaidan elf found in the Temple of Numiennen. She is grieving over something, and the only way to talk 		
	to her is to cheer her up. If you're female, buy her some sweets. If you're male, buy her some flowers. Both items 		
	are found at Samuel's in the City Center. Evanine will only join you if you're not investigating the rising evil out 		
	of greed or violence.
	<br>
	<br>
	iii) Montador
	<br>
	Montador is a grumpy warrior found in the Mercenary Guild in the Merchant's District. You'll have to convince the 		
	Bouncer to let you in. Despite his demeanor, he is the easiest henchmen to get in your party. You simply have to ask 		
	him.
</blockquote>
<br><a name=q4b>b. Jonas</a>
<br>When you patrol the Noble's District and head north from the fountain between the Goldfoot and Bedime estates, Winifred 
Bedime will appear and demand that you help her husband who is being attacked by a zombie. Even if you don't help and the 
Bedime's die, you'll still have to kill the zombie. If Winifred dies, she'll drop a key to her estate. After killing the zombie, 
you'll find a key that opens the door to Jonas the Cryptkeeper's home in the Graveyard District. In his home, you'll discover 
that Jonas has been killed by zombies and find a key to the Mausoleum. Before heading in, report this to Lord Rayson.
<br>
<br><a name=q4c>c. Werewolf Attack</a>
<br>When you patrol the Merchant's District near the fountain, a werewolf will attack the guards stationed at the South Gate. 
Lady Anaviel and her escort will arrive to help. Once the werewolf is dead, the gate to the Mistwood will remain open and Lady 
Anaviel will appear in the Hall of Elders to talk to you. She has some useful insight on people. Before you head off 
into the Mistwood, you should report the werewolf attack to Lord Rayson.
</blockquote>


<a href=#top2>top</a>
<br>
<hr width=100%></hr>

<a name=q5></a>
<br><a name=q5>5. Graveyard District</a>
<br>
Use the key found in the home of Jonas the Cryptkeeper to enter the Mausoleum.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q5a>a. Mausoleum</a>
<br>You'll find Amrod and his goons in the far end of the Mausoleum. If you get too close to them, they will attack, although 
Amrod will warn you before you get that far. If you hit the gong at the far end of the room with a ranged weapon, boulders 
will fall from the ceiling to soften up the mercenaries, although they will attack you after. Be sure to buff up for this 
battle because at this point you're likely very poorly equipped. You'll find a journal on Amrod... hang onto it.
<br>
<br><a name=q5b>b. Beneath The Mausoleum</a>
<br>Once you've dealt with Amrod, you can use the boulders at the far end of the room to enter a lower level. There is a 
tablet in the middle of the room that contains three receptacles. Enter each door at the far end of the level and try to 
open the coffin; each coffin will spawn a guardian which you have to kill to take a rod from. If you find them difficult, 
you can try to lure them to eachother; the guardian's hate eachother and will just as likely fight eachother as they are 
to fight you. Place the rods in the receptacles in this order: skeleton rod, mummy rod, zombie rod. This opens a portal 
to the next level.
<br>
You can use the coffin closest to Slythe's corpse to enter a sewer level that has some loot. If you click on the tracks 
near the deep sewer waters, it will explain where the zombies attacking Edinburg are coming from. Bashing open the chest 
in this sewer will cause a swarm of zombies to appear and attack.
<br>
<br><a name=q5c>c. Crypt Level 1</a>
<br>At the far end of this area, you will be approached by a ghost. Follow his conversation threads if you want the spirits 
to help you against Ezros in the next level.
<br>
<br><a name=q5d>d. Crypt Level 2</a>
<br>This is the lair of Ezros the lich. Where the bridges intersect, head east and grab the journal and helmet on the desk 
there. The helmet is important for a later quest... keep it. Talk to Ezros to get his explanation that he's sending zombies 
to attack Edinburg because mercenaries are cramping his style. If you try to get to the desks at the far end his lair, he 
will attack you. Fighting Ezros is optional otherwise. If you initiate a battle with Ezros and you've agreed to help the 
spirits earlier, they will appear to provide you with some buffing and healing magic. Ezros will respawn 3 minutes after 
death unless you destroy his phylactery which is found in a room behind a secret door where his platform points:
<br>
<br>
<pre>

/----\
|c   |
|    |
\----//----------\
      |a	 |
      |	 /-----	 |
      |  |b----  |
      |  | |     |

a = secret door
b = Ezros
c = phylactery

</pre>

You will need a decent search skill to find the secret door, so don't try to fight Ezros unless you have the means to find 
the door. Once you've bashed his phylactery, soul gems will appear on the ground. If you've agreed to help the spirits, you 
can smash the gems to free them, or keep the gems to sell (they're worth about 10000 gold). After speaking to Ezros, you can 
report your findings to Lord Rayson (with Amrod's journal).

<br><a name=q6></a>
6. Mistwood
<br>
Enter Mistwood after the werewolf attack on the Merchant's District.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q6a>a. Mistwood</a>
<br>Lomeldur is sitting around in the first area of Mistwood. You can ask him for advice, or you can rob him. Evanine will 
leave your party if you try to take Lomeldur's bow.
<br>
<br><a name=q6b>b. Druid Grove</a>
<br>Tenard, Shariana, and Audin will tell you about a run-in with a werewolf pack leader. Shariana won't talk to you if you 
robbed Lomeldur. Audin will be displeased with you if you killed Lomeldur, but he'll forgive you if you give him Lomeldur's 
bow. Don't bother trying to bluff him, he'll see right through you. Audin is the only NPC who provides free healing.
<br>
<br><a name=q6c>c. Deep Woods</a>
<br>The thick webs in the south should tell you what lies there. There is technically no limit to the number of dire spiders 
that will spawn, so don't go running through there unless you're prepared to fight them. One of the middle cocoons contains 
some good loot and a silk gland that you can return to Neferisia in the Emporium Magicana for a reward. The cave to the north 
contains three witches; make sure you've got some elemental protection if you want to fight them. Once the witches are dead, 
you can drink from the cauldron to get some XP, permanent +2 CON, and permanent -2 CHA... bards, sorcs, and pallys beware.
<br>
<br><a name=q6d>d. Heart of the Forest</a>
<br>You'll have a dream when you enter this area, simulating long travel time. Tobias appears again and asks what you plan to 
do when you run into the werewolf pack leader. Your conversation choices determine how you're rewarded (e.g. anger gives you 
+2 STR, logic gives you +2 to INT and WIS, and calm gives you +2 CON). After finishing the dream, you wander deeper in the 
wood and find a group of mercenaries fighting werewolves. Tyran automatically tries to talk to you after they've disposed of 
the werewolves. If you pry, you'll force Tyran's party to fight you. Ziglig will switch sides if you manage to persuade him. 
Once Tyran is dead, grab his journal... hang onto it.
<br>
<br><a name=q6e>e. Werewolf Lair</a>
<br>Upon entering the lair, a dwarf and former member of Tyran's party runs up to you. He'll turn into a werewolf no matter 
what you try. Grab his potion case. At the far end of the room is Cano, still injured from his fight with Audin (he still 
regenerates wounds you inflict on him). Cano will fight you no matter what you say to him. His death will give you a sense 
of closure after the werewolf attack on your home. After Cano's death, if you go outside  and you haven't already killed 
Tyran and his party, they will appear and try to rob you of your loot. Return to Lord Rayson and give him your report.
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>


<a href=#top2>top</a>
<br>
<hr width=100%></hr>

<br><a name=q7>7. Anfang</a>
<br>
You cannot investigate Anfang until you've completed both the Ezros and Cano quests. You have to get authorization from 
Captain Thorin before you're allowed to pass the gates. Speak to Farmer Hurst in the Quilted Saddle Inn before going.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q7a>a. Outlying Farms</a>
<br>There are orcs in the barn and on the hill to the northwest. If you've agreed to kill the orc chief, take his head and 
return it to Hurst for your reward.
<br>
<br><a name=q7b>b. Edge of the Forest</a>
<br>There is a cave to the north where three trolls lie. Make sure you have ample fire and/or acid. In the upper level of 
the cave, you'll find Lorien. Wear the Helm of True Sight you got from Ezros' lair to dispel the magic hiding the path to 
Anfang forest (where the two trees and two large boulders lie on the southern side of the map).
<br>
<br><a name=q7c>c. Anfang Forest</a>
<br>To find your way through the three Anfang maps, find the ruins and head in the direction that they're pointing:
	<br>
	<pre>

	-------------------------
	|			|
	|	 -- --		|		
	|	|   --		|
        |       |  |            |
	|	 --		|
	|	 		|
	-------------------------

	For example, if the ruins look like this, head east.

	</pre>

<a name=q7d>d. Castle Mordred</a>
<br>There is a house south of the closed inn where you can pick up a book that suggests a plague had killed off most of 
Mordred's citizens many years ago. Head north to enter the castle.
<br>
</blockquote>

<a href=#top3>top</a>
<br>
<hr width=100%></hr>

<a name=q8></a>
<br><a name=q8>8. Castle Mordred</a>
<br>
The citizens of this cheery place died because of a power-struggle between the three brothers Ezros, Cano, and Drakkar a 
century ago.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q8a>a. Level 1</a>
<br>You're greeted by an odd-looking halfling butler who asks you to leave, then teleports away. On the eastern side, there 
is a room with invisible traps that spring everytime you step on them. Follow the little ghost girl who appears every couple 
of minutes to avoid stepping on them. If you head west, you'll find an entrance to the basement. Rummage through a desk there 
to find a key to open the door at the far end of the room.
<br>
<br><a name=q8b>b. Level 2</a>
<br>The odd-looking butler appears again and warns you about going further, then teleports away again. When you enter the 
fountain room, you'll have to speak to Asheara. The vampiress will let you pass unharmed if you convince her that you're 
greedy, evil, or corrupt, but she'll attack you if you're too righteous or paranoid. She teleports her pet, the fallen 
paladin Gareth Nubrin, in combat. If you kill Asheara or Gareth, you can only stake them if you have a holy stake from 
the Temple.
<br>
<br><a name=q8c>c. Level 3</a>
<br>The odd-looking butler appears again, but this time he turns into a fiend. After killing him, you can find three 
journals belonging to Ezros, Cano, and Drakkar that explain the history behind Castle Mordred's disaster and disappearance. 
Drakkar awaits in the furthest room. He'll explain to you that Lord Rayson himself is behind a ritual forcing vampires to 
enter a feeding-frenzy, but he lies to you about knowing nothing about Lord Rayson's family. If you choose to fight him and 
stake him, you'll find Safana's brooch and Merilee's doll in his coffin... Drakkar murdered Lord Rayson's family. Return to 
Edinburg with everything you've learned.

<br><a name=q9>9. Shadowmasters</a>
<br>
When you return to Edinburg, you'll find that the Thieve's Guild has closed, although if you've worked for them before, Benny 
will give you a key to enter the Guild to rest.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q9a>a. Rayson's Disappearance</a>
<br>When you try to find Lord Rayson in the Hall of Elders, you'll discover that he hasn't been seen for a couple of days, so 
report everything you find to Captain Thorin instead. Thorin, Tamerlin, Anaviel, and Takash gather to discuss everything you've 
learned. A thief will appear in the Hall of Elders and explain that the Bloody Daggers have found a way into the lair of the 
Shadow Weavers. Thorin will agree to help the Bloody Daggers in their assault on the Weavers. You're sent to ask Oris and the 
Temple of Numiennen for help.
<br>
<br><a name=q9b>b. Deep Slums Battle</a>
<br>After asking for Oris' help, you have to rest to trigger the battle. Go to the Deep Slums gate and speak to Thorin. You'll 
enter the Deep Slums where a fight with the Shadow Weavers is taking place. You don't have to fight the Weavers, although there 
is a limit on how many will spawn, so you could go on a killing spree if you'd like. Go to the southeast section of the map where 
the Bloody Daggers are and find the secret door behind Kyra or Frido. Thorin will ask you to enter first.
<br>
<br><a name=q9c>c. Shadow Weaver Lair</a>
<br>If Kyra is there, you've worked for the Bloody Daggers before, and you have one henchmen or less, she'll offer to help you. 
Benny will tell you that Ameril and the other Bloody Daggers have gone ahead to clear a path for you. Head down to the end to 
find a portal to the Chamber of the Shadowmasters.
<br>
<br><a name=q9d>d. Shadowmasters</a>
<br>When you arrive in the chamber, you'll see a ritual device churning away behind three ghostly Shadowmasters. Ameril and 
many of the Bloody Daggers have been killed. The Shadowmasters will confirm that Lord Rayson hired them to conduct the ritual, 
but they tricked him because the device only makes vampires hungry. While the city was busy with rising evil, they took their 
time to setup shop. Just before the Shadowmasters attack, Thorin, Oris, and company arrive to help you. Kill all three 
Shadowmasters, then remove one or both of the ingredients in each ritual receptacle to make it blow up. Then enter the portal 
at the back of the room to exit (if you have Safana's brooch and/or Merilee's doll, take them from your henchmen before exiting 
the Chamber of the Shadowmasters).

<br><a name=q10>10. Conclusion</a>
<br>
The portal you entered collapses, so your henchmen, Thorin and the others can't follow you.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q10a>a. Moonbow Estate</a>
<br>When you enter the Moonbow Estate, you'll find Lord Rayson staring at a statue of his wife. He truly regrets everything he's 
done. If you have Safana's Brooch and/or Merilee's doll, you can give them to him so he knows his family has been avenged, or you 
can withhold them if you're evil. Lord Rayson knows the Elder Council will go easy on his punishment, but he knows he deserves 
death... so he kills himself.
<br>
<br><a name=q10b>b. Hall of Elders</a>
<br>A week has passed since Lord Rayson's suicide. You'll appear in the Hall of Elders where your henchmen are waiting for you. 
Thorin has replaced Lord Rayson, and if you worked for the City Guard and have a good reputation with him, he'll ask you to consider 
a position as a City Guard Commander. Tamerlin will ask you to consider a position as the new leader of the Bloody Daggers if you had 
a good reputation with Ameril. You should speak to Anaviel last. She thanks you for saving Edinburg and rewards you... you'll be 
moved to the last area.
<br>
<br><a name=q10c>c. A Flashback</a>
<br>You have a flashback of a time long ago when your stepparents were still alive. There are hints that they knew something of your 
heritage but never told you, and suggest that you have a future in Istar.
<br>.
<br>.
<br>.
<br>THE END

11. Tips & Explanations
<br>
This section contains tips regarding important characters and various areas. These are sort of like Easter Eggs in that they're 
things that aren't explicity explained in the module.
<blockquote>
<br><a name=q11a>a. NPCs</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
	a) Anaviel
	<br>- will give you insight on Castle Mordred and Jeswick Edin if you've asked Thorin about them
	<br>- will speak to you about her concerns about Lord Rayson if you have a good reputation with her, which can be
 	achieved by being nice to her in conversation
	<br><br>
	b) Asheara
	<br>- you actually get better loot if you don't fight her; the loot is found in chests that spawn in the room across
 	the hall
	<br><br>
	c) Braden/Mela	
	<br>- if you side with Braden in your report, you can talk to Braden afterwards and make him admit he has feelings
 	for Mela; when you next visit the Boar, Braden and Mela have gotten together and are moving to the Government
 	District; you can spot their new home in the southeast side of the District and get some free booze and rest
	<br><br>
	d) Cano
	<br>- will regenerate quickly, but does not regenerate electrical damage 
	<br>- your dialogue with Cano is affected by your conversation in your previous dream about Tobias (e.g. if you
 	promised to avenge Tobias, you'll have angry dialogue options with Cano)
	<br><br>
	e) Chapelle
	<br>- will only sell you a tunic to get into the Fox's Tail if you've agreed to help Lord Rayson
	<br>- will give you a reward if you helped the Bedimes in the zombie attack without asking for a reward
	<br><br>
	f) Denholm
	<br>- will give you insight on Castle Mordred and Jeswick Edin if you've asked Thorin about them; mentions Brooks 		
	Hillsprings, whom you'll meet in Castle Mordred as the strange butler
	<br><br>
	g) Evanine
	<br>- your reputation with Evanine drops if you fire her at any time
	<br>- some of her dialogue and interjections are dependent on previous dialogues/interjections; if you want to 			
	see all of her dialogue, make sure you talk to her before heading to Anfang
	<br>- you will lose future interjections and conversation threads if you choose evil responses or show disinterest in 	
	dialogue
	<br>- her last interjection occurs just before you return to Edinburg after dealing with Drakkar, and it will only 		
	appear if you've asked her about her parents and her uncle (so make sure you've gone through her dialogue options 		
	before then)
	<br><br>
	h) Gaul
	<br>- if you're nice to Mela, you can talk to Gaul and threaten him to stop harrassing Mela; report this to Mela 		
	after Gaul runs away for some XP
	<br><br>
	i) Hurst
	<br>- if you ask for a reward to kill the orc chief, he'll give you a magic sickle; if you don't ask for a reward, 		
	you'll get more XP when you return the chief's head
	<br><br>
	j) Lord Rayson
	<br>- when he rewards you out of his pocket after dealing with Ezros and Cano, the reward is dependent on your 			
	reputation with him... the better your reputation, the better your reward
	<br><br>
	k) Lorien
	<br>- he will give you Lanelle's Harp only if you have bard level(s); bards can use Lanelle's Harp to summon Lorien 		
	for a short time once a day
	<br><br>
	l) Montador
	<br>- will mock you if you're male and you choose touchy-feely questions
	<br>- will force a fight with Amrod and his party in the Mausoleum
	<br>- his last dialogue with female PCs will only occur if you've gone through all of his dialogue threads and you've 	
	shown interest in his interjections
	<br><br>
	m) Neferisia
	<br>- opens her store to you if you ask her about the items she collects
	<br>- you can ask her about the rising evil after you've reported your encounters with Ezros and/or Cano
	<br>- her reward for the silk gland varies depending on your honesty; if you tell her you picked up both a helmet and 	
	scimitar, she'll give you the best reward; you don't have to be greedy because she lets you keep them regardless; 		
	don't bother trying to bluff her, she'll see right through you
	<br><br>
	n) Persey
	<br>- will call you master or use your first name depending on your conversation when you first tell her that you've 		
	freed her from Bentley
	<br>- will compare you to her first master if you don't help the Bedimes in the zombie attack, which prevents certain dialogues from 	
	appearing in the future
	<br>- will compare you to her first master if you try to rob Lomeldur of his bow, which prevents certain dialogues from 			
	appearing in the future
	<br>- your reputation with Persey drops if you fire her at any time
	<br>- some of her dialogue and interjections are dependent on previous dialogues/interjections; if you want to 			
	see all of her dialogue, make sure you talk to her before heading to Anfang
	<br>- you will lose future interjections and conversation threads if you choose evil responses or show disinterest in 	
	dialogue
	<br><br>
	o) Rayne
	<br>- you cannot ask her opinions of Ameril and the Bloody Daggers unless you listen to her story
	<br>- both Rayne and Tomar will be gone when you've returned from dealing with Drakkar unless you've listened to her 	
	<br><br>
	p) Trolls
	<br>- will regenerate quickly, but do not regenerate fire or acid damage
	<br><br>
	q) Vampires
	<br>- will regenerate quickly, but do not regenerate fire or divine damage
	<br><br>
	r) Werewolves
	<br>- will regenerate quickly, but do not regenerate electrical damage
	<br><br>
	s) Ziglig
	<br>- if you persuade him to help you, his most valuable equipment spawns in Cano's lair, so you don't have to worry 		
	about losing out on his loot

<br>

<br><a name=q11b>b. Maps</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
	a) Anfang
	<br>- you can speak to the deer if you're a ranger or druid
	<br>- on the second Anfang map, you'll see some vampires slaughtering some orcs; this is meant to explain why orcs 		
	have invaded the outlying farms... they've been chased out
	<br><br>
	b) Boat Club
	<br>- if you're wearing the waiter's uniform found on the upper floor of a house in the City Center, the antsy 			
	cloakroom servant will let you watch the door while he relieves himself; you can help yourself to the loot in the 		
	cloakroom, but you'll take a chaotic alignment hit
	<br><br>
	c) Castle Mordred Basement
	<br>- the two gold and silver necklaces found in the chest in the torture room determine how many angry skeletons are 	
	spawned when you try to leave the basement
	<br><br>
	d) Chamber of the Shadowmasters
	<br>- you cannot approach the ritual device until all three Shadowmasters are dead
	<br>- you cannot enter the portal until the ritual device is disabled
	<br>- if Montador died in the battle, raise him before exiting if you want to see him in the Hall of Elders
	<br><br>
	e) Deep Slums
	<br>- the vampire attack in the Deep Slums does not yield specific information regarding the rising evil, but it does 	
	tell you that the Shadow Weavers are not allies of vampires
	<br><br>
	f) Library
	<br>- everytime you take a book from the library outside without paying for it, you take a chaotic alignment shift; 		
	even if you return to the library and exit again with the same book, you'll take another hit, so if you plan on 		
	robbing the library, do it all at once and leave your books outside
	<br><br>
	g) Mausoleum
	<br>- you can speak to the rats if you're a ranger or druid
	<br><br>
	gh) Mistwood
	<br>- you can speak to the deer if you're a ranger or druid
	<br><br>
	i) Shadowmaster Lair
	<br>- there are secret doors at the west and eastern sides of the large middle room
	<br>- you can avoid most of the traps and Shadow Weavers if you follow the trail of dead bodies... this is the path 		
	the Bloody Daggers have cleared for you
	<br><br>
	j) Thieve's Guild Lower Level
	<br>- if you leave anything in the training chests, the items will be moved to the cabinet next to Tomar (try not to 		
	leave anything important in there, I can't guarantee that it won't disappear!)
</blockquote>

<a href=#top4>top</a>
<br>

<br><a name=q11c>c. Items</a>
<br>
<blockquote>
	a) Gaea's Whistle
	<br>- the higher your Animal Empathy skill, the more powerful the summoned animal is; possible summons from weakest 		
	to most powerful are a white stag, hound, lion, and bear
	<br><br>
	b) Lanelle's Harp
	<br>- can be used once per day to summon Lorien; only bards will receive the harp from Lorien in the first place
	<br><br>
	c) Violin of Valienna
	<br>- the higher your Perform skill, the more Bigby's Interposing Hands are created; very useful against strong melee 	
	opponents
	<br><br>
	d) Water of Shesesen
	<br>- heals the imbiber to full hit points, removes negative effects, restores all spells, and recharges all items
